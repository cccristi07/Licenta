1. Introduction  [2-3 pag] - 4 pag DONE
- motivation
- what all the chapters do

2. about EPANET and resulting simulations [10 pag] DONE
- why is a waternetwork difficult to handle; equations
- modeling tools (epanet)
- practical details about epanet and its integration with python (dll, details about the inp file format; measures of interest)
- for further use we consider hanoi case (details + pic)
- measures of interest, illustrations: 
		* dynamic behavior for all nodes under nominal load; 
		* dynamic behavior for a subset of nodes with varied load scenarios;
		* dynamic behavior for a subset of nodes with emitter;
- Sa arat si ceva despre celelalte caracteristici ale retelei VELOCITY si DEMAND eventual		

3. Fault scenarios and residual definition [8 pag] - 10 pag DONE
- about faults: magnitude variation through emitter (plot for various magnitudes affecting the same node)
- types of residuals (absolute and relative formulations; discussions about stationary state): 
- sensor selection for fault detection and isolation: decide on a threshold, construct binary matrix M, use it in a set covering problem to decide on the selected sensors
		* plot to highlight the selected sensors

4. fault detection and isolation using SVM [7-8 pag]
- https://topepo.github.io/caret/recursive-feature-elimination.html
- SVM
- Recursive Feature Ellimination pt selectia senzorilor

5. fault detection and isolation via dictionary learning [10 pag]
- dictionary learning problem
- particularization of DL parameters
- run for the residuals selected from chapter 3 
- illustrations about DL training and DL classification
- tables with performance in different scenarios

6. a large scale example [3-4 pag] - nu stiu daca il mai pun
- the barcelona waternetwork

7. conclusions and future directions [2 pag]
